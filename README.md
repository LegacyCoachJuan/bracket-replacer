# bracket-replacer
The goal of this project is to develop a Word Add-in to find and replace text surrounded by brackets to allow any document to become a template simply by typing brackets around the text that needs to be changed.

Simply add brackets around repetitive text items and this add-in allows you to replace all of those instances in a form-like interface.
